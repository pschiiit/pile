# Pile

This project is an attempt to provide au [Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/)-like
 unified API for PHP web apps. Because of the nature of PHP, its goal
will be focused on the middleware stack rather than on the webserver
interface.

Many pieces of code related to requests and environment are extracted
from [Limonade PHP](https://github.com/sofadesign/limonade/).

It's in early stage of development, so please, dont'use it in
production.
